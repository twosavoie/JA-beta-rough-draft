                <!-- <p>I've made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island, with my small growing family. My journey into
                    tech
                    started with a degree in journalism. As I started sharing my writing online, I was fascinated with
                    how
                    easily I could get my voice out there. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to
                    fit
                    my own specific needs.</p>
                <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first
                    website,
                    I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work.
                    Now
                    I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for
                    detail to write clean, elegant code.</p> -->
                <p>My tech journey started with a degree in journalism. I loved researching, writing, and sharing my
                    voice online, but something felt missing. I wished for a way to share and display information
                    exactly the way I wanted. That's when I discovered and fell in love with coding and web design!</p>
                <p>As a front end developer, I pride myself on writing code that's easy to read and build upon while
                    still looking great. My goal with every site is to provide a top-of-the-line user experience.
                    Besides web development, I enjoy gardening and spending time with my small (but growing!) family.
